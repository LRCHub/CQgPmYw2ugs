Say goodbye to your
Little underdog
No more run and catch
Things you throw my way

The collar's off
Take good care of yourself
We're bound for glory
But there's a price to pay

Not that you care you'll find me
By the riverside
Baptize the maker where the
Water is clear and wide

Like a smokers cough
Reveals a bitter truth
Please don't kid yourself
Now's the time to stop

The climb is high
But the air is clean
We're bound for glory
Just let the covers drop

I'll be celebrating
By the riverside
Baptize the maker where the
Water is clear
And nowhere left to hide
Down by the riverside

I'll be celebrating
By the riverside
Baptize the maker where the
Water is clear
And nowhere left to hide
Down by the riverside
