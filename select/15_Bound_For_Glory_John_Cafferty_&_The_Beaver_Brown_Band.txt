Well I'm just hangin' tight
And the moons hangin' low
I got some Detroit wheels
And I'm ready to go

I bought an old Jerry Lee tape
I bought a tank full of gas
I got some wild ideas
I wanna move on 'em fast

*Hey don't you worry bout me
This ain't no hard luck story
Ain't no doubt about it
Man i'm bound for glory
Ain't no doubt about it
Man I'm bound for glory
Ain't no two ways about it
Man I'm bound for glory

I got a pretty little girl
Across the south county line
All day long down at that shipyard
She's been on my mind

I know a rockin' little joint
Right off of route 95
Man you oughta' see her dance
She really lets it unwind

Repeat*

Well tonight tonight
I'm gonna turn it all around
Come on let's go and play
The only game left in this town
I wanna see some bright lights
I wanna lay some money down
I can feel it in my bones
Tonight were glory bound
-Whooooooooooo_

I ride a ragtop convertible
Mustang Ford
Registration G-L-O-R-Y
Come on and climb aboard

I got my foot pressed to the floor
I got my hands tight on the wheel
I got my mind set on the good life
Just gotta know how it feels

Repeat*
