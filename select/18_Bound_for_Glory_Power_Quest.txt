Far beyond this world
Far beyond this night
Far beyond the universe
And far beyond this life

When it all comes down to life
Welcome to the danger zone
You never know what fate will throw your way
In the blinking of an eye
Life will change for evermore
One minute you were there and now you're gone

So farewell, until we meet again
On the other side where our horizon's blue
Who knows, when the day will dawn
We can open our hearts and be free

Far beyond this world
Far beyond this night
Far beyond the universe
And far beyond this life

Far beyond the Sun
Far beyond the grave
Sacred wings of destiny
Bound for glory we arise

There are times for us to pray
Pray there is another way
A way to turn back time and live again
There are times for us to see
See what we do not believe
The truth is always hidden in the lies

So farewell, until we meet again
On the other side where our horizon's blue
Who knows, when the day will dawn
We can open our hearts and be free

Far beyond this world
Far beyond this night
Far beyond the universe
And far beyond this life

Far beyond the Sun
Far beyond the grave
Sacred wings of destiny
Bound for glory we arise

So farewell, until we meet again
On the other side where our horizon's blue
Who knows, when the day will dawn
We can open our hearts and be free

Far beyond this world
Far beyond this night
Far beyond the universe
And far beyond this life

Far beyond the Sun
Far beyond the grave
Sacred wings of destiny
Bound for glory we arise
